# Installing VScode
First, go to the VScode website. Here is the link: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Hit the blue "Download" button in the top right corner of the website. Now click the downloads button that corresponds to your device. For example, if you have a Mac then click the bright blue button that says "Mac" on it. Once the .zip file is downloaded, click on it and open VScode.
You should see a screen similar to this:
